I have set up the serverless project.
Defined db-tables.
Added stumps for (most of) the required functions.
Added endpoints in serverless.yml
Added boilerplate code for signUp and login, and sendResponse.

Switched to postNote branch.

Fixed import errors

Deployed to aws:
- signUp works
-logIn works
(Not much error handling yet)

Added basic postNote function.
Deployed
Committed  and pushed to postNote branch:
postNoteAddedFixedImportErrors

Tested with Insomnia:
Now it is possible to post a note

Merged and deleted branch postNote

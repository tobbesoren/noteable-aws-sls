I have set up the serverless project.
Defined db-tables.
Added stumps for (most of) the required functions.
Added endpoints in serverless.yml
Added boilerplate code for signUp and login, and sendResponse.

Switched to postNote branch.

Fixed import errors

Deployed to aws:
- signUp works
-logIn works
(Not much error handling yet)

Added basic postNote function.
Deployed
Committed  and pushed to postNote branch:
postNoteAddedFixedImportErrors

Tested with Insomnia:
Now it is possible to post a note

Merged and deleted branch postNote

Switched to getNotes branch

Added getNotes
Added verifyToken

Committed and pushed to getNotes branch:
addedGetNotesAndVerifyToken

Merged and deleted getNotes branch

Fixed small bugs, pushed directly to main.

Deployed.
getNotes works, but it gets all notes since auth isn't implemented in postNote

Switched to new branch: workingBranch - I need to get auth to work and probably will work on multiple files.
